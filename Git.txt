create a repository in our github it will generate an url copy the url and paste it in the below command

git remote add origin link
git - git
remote - working with url
add - adding new url
origin - name of the url


git push origin master(branchname) - to push our project to our github


git branch branchname - to create a new branch

git checkout branchname to change the branch

head is like a pointer

git merge branchname - to merge a branch to our masterbranch


contribuiting to other projects:
create a copy of the project - fork
clone the project 
git clone url

git remote add upstream url - from where the projects is copied or cloned




pull request -- To give our project to another project

Make new branches so that it can be easily managed

git push origin filename -f (Force push)

git fetch --all --prune  ------> Fetching all the details

git reset --hard upstream/main --> to see what in project and my folder

git pull upstream main --> to pull the url in main

merge all the commits 
git rebase -i url


what if both peoples made changes to a single line and commit it -- merge conflict we can change it manually
